## ü§ì Interests
I always had a knack for tinkering with things and building a deeper understanding of how stuff works.
Picking up programming was simply a natural progression of that curiosity. Here's a small sample of things that fascinate me:

- **Swift** - My favourite programming language. Learning about its inner workings is what I love doing :)
- **iOS Development** - Creating applications that people use is something that really brings me joy.
- **Graphics Programming** - Rendering techniques and how it's possible to simulate real-world is something that I really want to get a good understanding of.
- **C++** - Language that I was always drawn to, but also intimidated by. Due to my fascination with graphics programming, I picked it up recently.
- **Guitar** - One of my biggest passions in life. Can't imagine my life without it.
- **Photography** - Indirectly sparked my interest in computer graphics :)

## üå± Currently learning
- **Apple Metal**
- **C++**
- **CMake**
- **SFML**
- **Audio Programming**
- **Optimization Techniques**
